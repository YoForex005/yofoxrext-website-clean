## User Preferences

### Communication Style
- Use simple, everyday language
- Avoid technical jargon when explaining to user
- Be concise and clear

### Task Execution Workflow (CRITICAL - ALWAYS FOLLOW)

**When starting ANY new work session:**

1. **Error Dashboard Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
   - **ALWAYS** check error monitoring dashboard at `/admin/errors` BEFORE starting ANY new task
   - Review all unsolved/active errors first (check database and admin panel)
   - Fix ALL critical and high-severity errors before proceeding with new work
   - Verify no TypeScript errors, routing errors, API errors, database errors, or connection issues
   - Check ALL logs: frontend console logs, backend Express logs, Next.js build logs
   - Review error categories: Unsolved, Solved, To-Be-Solved
   - Document all fixes in the task list
   - **This ensures system stability before adding new features or making changes**
   - **NEVER skip this step - ALL errors must be resolved first before starting new work**

**When receiving a new task:**

2. **Deep Analysis Phase**
   - Think thoroughly about the task before starting
   - Consider all edge cases and implications
   - Identify potential challenges upfront

3. **Planning Phase (MANDATORY)**
   - Call `architect` tool with `responsibility: "plan"` to get strategic guidance
   - Break down complex tasks into clear, logical subtasks
   - Create comprehensive plan with dependencies identified
   - Document the approach before implementation

4. **Delegation Phase**
   - Use `start_subagent` for complex, multi-step subtasks
   - Provide clear context and success criteria to subagents
   - Ensure subagents have all necessary file paths and context

5. **Autonomous Execution**
   - **DO NOT ask user for confirmation mid-task**
   - Work through entire task list to completion
   - Handle errors and obstacles independently
   - Only return to user when task is 100% complete or genuinely blocked

6. **Documentation Phase (MANDATORY)**
   - Update replit.md regularly during work
   - Document what was changed and why
   - Keep documentation clean, organized, and current
   - Remove outdated information
   - Add completion dates to major changes

7. **Review Phase (BEFORE COMPLETION)**
   - Call `architect` with `responsibility: "evaluate_task"` to review all work
   - Fix any issues architect identifies
   - Only mark tasks complete after architect approval

### Documentation Standards

- **Update Frequency:** After each major change
- **Keep Clean:** Remove outdated/deprecated information
- **Be Specific:** Include file paths, dates, and reasons for changes
- **Section Organization:** Recent Changes should list newest first with dates
